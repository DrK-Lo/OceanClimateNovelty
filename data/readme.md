20181102 Me with Liqing:

Info about the data:

1) Information about the data and references from Liqing

- RCP 8.5, RCP 4.5 for comparison
- CMIP5 is one of the models
- ESM2M1 model that we have data from

Liqing - will send model output for RCP 4.5, real data, and add pH to the data he sent us, 
and some references

real data he suggested:
ESTOC, HOT, BATS

2) Discussion about other (more frequent) sources of data for ICV calculation
3) Discussion about the attached Hensen paper (just skim it), the data they used, and what novel contribution our paper would make
4) Make a plan

Model output:

From Henson et al: Output from 12 IPCC-class Earth system models run for the CMIP5 exercise driven by greenhouse gas, aerosol and ozone concentrations prescribed in a specific representative concentration pathway scenario of climate change were downloaded from the archive at http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/ data_portal.html. The models and institutions providing the output are listed in Supplementary Table 1. For all models the monthly output for 100-year sections taken from the end of the preindustrial control run, the historical run (1860â€“2005)


Depth data:



1) Novelty will be lower at the poles as existing climate envelopes shift northward

2) Novelty in ocean compared to terrestrial
 (North America)

3) Consider novelty of MAT as opposed to seasonal max/min

3) For poles and other areas with low novelty, where do the existing climates come from?
-> new angle would be to include depth in novelty calculation

* large_files - surface data from Liqing, values for 1800-1830, 1970-2000, 2070-2100, generated from ESM2M model, adjusted to year 2000, under RCP8.5 conditions
* real_data - Contains data from HOT and BATS

## Files

* Data_subsurface - subsurface data from Liqing, need to clarify source
