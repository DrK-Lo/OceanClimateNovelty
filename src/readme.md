* `0-Novelty_Oceans_Functions.R`: These are functions for doing the analysis 
* `2b-plot_sd-l_wholeoceanbase.R`: Some crude plots of the amount of standard deviation
* `3-Novelty_Oceans_stnd_annual_NShemisphere.R`: With this code the novelty calc is restricted to the N or S hemisphere.
* `5-IllustrateNovelty.Rmd` Code used to create conceptual Figure 1
* `7-Real_dat_code.R`: Aki's code for comparing the SD of the model to real data


# /unpub
This folder contains unpublished code for analysis
* `1-Novelty_Oceans_stnd_annual_wholeoceanbase.R`: The analysis using the global ocean as the base for calculating novelty
* `2-PlotResultsl_wholeoceanbase.Rmd`: Some crude plots of the results from 1. Plots in the manuscript were
made by Liqing in Matlab.
* `Biooracle.R`: We didn't end up using the Biooracle data, because it lacks reconstructions, but may want to consider it for the future
